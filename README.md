# Dimensions

borwell software challenge / sample Unity application

by Jon Rummery (jonrummery@gmail.com)


Build instructions :

(1) clone repository

(2) open with Unty (2018.2.1f1 or later) : 'File' -> 'Open Project'

(3) open scene : 'Assets' -> 'Scenes' -> 'Scene_Dim'

(4) play : 'File' -> 'Play'


Notes :

(1) all scripts (including mouse movement) are written by me

(2) no plug-ins have been used (not even 'Unity Standard Assets')

(3) navigation : keyboard (wasd or cursor keys) and mouse. Left-click to select. Left-click and hold to adjust sliders.


ToDo :

(1) clear previous results when changing units

(2) reset sliders when changing units

(3) add audio cue on button press (and slider?)

(4) change 'feet' to 'foot' if result is '1' (and 'metres' to 'metre' etc)

(5) combine 'Calculate' and 'Units' scripts (duplication of inputs)
